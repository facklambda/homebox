notable stuff: 

fedora-iot is the platform i'm doing this all on
fetchit appuser gets a /var/home/ ~/ (idk why but i expected it to be more trad like /home/ ~)

had to create some folders after creating the app user 

sudo useradd -r -s /sbin/nologin fetchit

sudo mkdir /var/home/fetchit/.fetchit/config.yaml
sudo mkdir /var/home/fetchit/.config/systemd/user/
sudo chown -R fetchit:fetchit /var/home/fetchit/
